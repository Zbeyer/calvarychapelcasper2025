    <p>Welcome to Calvary Chapel Casper! It is our desire that you find a place to get plugged in and grow in Godâ€™s will for your life within a fellowship of believers. There are many churches in the area that are great places to grow and thrive. We would like to share a little about our fellowship as you consider where God may have you grow. We place a strong emphasis on knowing the entire counsel of God. During weekly service times Pastor Bob takes the fellowship chapter by chapter and by verse. Once a book is been taught, a new book is selected to cover from beginning to end. During Wednesday evening services we study verse by verse from Genesis to Revelation until the entire Bible is covered.
