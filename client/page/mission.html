		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<h4>
			"TO KNOW HIM AND MAKE HIM KNOWN" we do this through these four things:
		</h4>

		<h3>Abide</h3>
		<p>
		<blockquote>
			"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the
			vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me." – John 15:4
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		Our First priority is our ministry to Christ, our relationship with Him in which all other good things
		resonate from.
		<br>
		<blockquote>
			"Then those who [m]gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand
			souls were added to them.
			<br>
			42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ [n]doctrine and fellowship, in
			the breaking of bread, and in prayers." – Acts 2:41-42
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		By taking in the word of God, having fellowship with Him, coming to communion table with Him, and that leads
		us to the next point of praying with Him.
		</p>

		<h3>Pray</h3>
		<p>
		<blockquote>
			"Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His
			disciples said to Him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.”" – Luke 11:1
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		As we know Him, we want to talk with Him, hear from Him, in order to do those things, He has called us to
		do. A vital part of knowing Him is communicating with Him, building that personal relationship with Him. Knowing
		what it is He wants us to do, rather than just doing. Being one with Him, connecting with our Heavenly Father
		just as Jesus did.
		</p>

		<h3>Love</h3>
		<p>
		<blockquote>
			"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you
			also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another." –
			John 13:34-35
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		As we abide in Christ this will reflect in our relationships with one another, as the fruit of the Spirit is
		love. Our love for one another is one our best witnessing tools we have in making Him known, the true change He
		has made in us.
		</p>

		<h3>Serve</h3>
		<p>
		<blockquote>
			He answered and said to them, “He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none; and he
			who has food, let him do likewise.” – Luke 3:11
		</blockquote>
		<br>

		<blockquote>
			"So He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them." – Matthew 8:15
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<blockquote>
			"just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”" –
			Matthew 20:28
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		As we abide in Him touched and healed by Him; pray with Him and love one another that love then flows out to
		others and we serve others for His name’s sake. Giving to others reflects the life of Christ as He gave
		Himself for us,

		<blockquote>
			"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not
			perish but have everlasting life." – John 3:16
		</blockquote>

		Knowing Him and making Him known will ultimately leads to serving Him in giving to others just as He gave to us.
