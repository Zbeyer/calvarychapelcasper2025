    <p>
      Welcome to Calvary Chapel Casper!
      It is our desire that you find a place to get plugged in and grow in Godâ€™s will for your life within a fellowship of believers.
      There are many churches in the area that are great places to grow and thrive.
      We would like to share a little about our fellowship as you consider where God may have you grow.
      We place a strong emphasis on knowing the entire counsel of God.
      During weekly service times Pastor Bob takes the fellowship chapter by chapter and by verse.
      Once a book is been taught, a new book is selected to cover from beginning to end. During Wednesday evening services we study verse by verse from Genesis to Revelation until the entire Bible is covered.
